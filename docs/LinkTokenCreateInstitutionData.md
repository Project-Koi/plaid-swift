Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**routingNumber** | **String** | The routing number of the bank to highlight in Link. Note: in rare cases, a single routing number can be associated with multiple institutions, e.g. due to a brokerage using another institution to manage ACH on its sweep accounts. If this happens, the bank will not be highlighted in Link even if the routing number is provided. | [optional]
