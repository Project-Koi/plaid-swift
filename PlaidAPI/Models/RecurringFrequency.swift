/** Describes the frequency of the transaction stream.  &#x60;WEEKLY&#x60;: Assigned to a transaction stream that occurs approximately every week.  &#x60;BIWEEKLY&#x60;: Assigned to a transaction stream that occurs approximately every 2 weeks.  &#x60;SEMI_MONTHLY&#x60;: Assigned to a transaction stream that occurs approximately twice per month. This frequency is typically seen for inflow transaction streams.  &#x60;MONTHLY&#x60;: Assigned to a transaction stream that occurs approximately every month.  &#x60;ANNUALLY&#x60;: Assigned to a transaction stream that occurs approximately every year.  &#x60;DAILY&#x60;: Assigned to a transaction stream that occurs approximately every day.  &#x60;DYNAMIC&#x60;: Assigned to a transaction stream that varies in recurrence frequency. This frequency is typically seen for inflow streams in the gig economy.  &#x60;UNKNOWN&#x60;: Assigned to a transaction stream that isn&#39;t recurring in nature. */
