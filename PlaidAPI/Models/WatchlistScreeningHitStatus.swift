/** The current state of review. All watchlist screening hits begin in a &#x60;pending_review&#x60; state but can be changed by creating a review. When a hit is in the &#x60;pending_review&#x60; state, it will always show the latest version of the watchlist data Plaid has available and be compared against the latest customer information saved in the watchlist screening. Once a hit has been marked as &#x60;confirmed&#x60; or &#x60;dismissed&#x60; it will no longer be updated so that the state is as it was when the review was first conducted. */
