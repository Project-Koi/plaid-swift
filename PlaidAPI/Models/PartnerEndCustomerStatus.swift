/** The status of the given end customer.  &#x60;UNDER_REVIEW&#x60;: The end customer has been created and enabled in the non-Production environments. The end customer must be manually reviewed by the Plaid team before it can be enabled in production, at which point its status will automatically transition to &#x60;PENDING_ENABLEMENT&#x60; or &#x60;DENIED&#x60;.  &#x60;PENDING_ENABLEMENT&#x60;: The end customer is ready to be enabled in the Production environment. Call the &#x60;/partner/customer/enable&#x60; endpoint to enable the end customer in Production.  &#x60;ACTIVE&#x60;: The end customer has been enabled in all environments.  &#x60;DENIED&#x60;: The end customer has been created and enabled in the non-Production environments, but it did not pass review by the Plaid team and therefore cannot be enabled in the Production environment.
