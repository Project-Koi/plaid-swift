/** An enum indicating the match type between two Beacon Users.   &#x60;match&#x60; indicates that the provided input data was a strong match against the other Beacon User.  &#x60;partial_match&#x60; indicates the data approximately matched the other Beacon User. For example, \&quot;Knope\&quot; vs. \&quot;Knope-Wyatt\&quot; for last name.  &#x60;no_match&#x60; indicates that Plaid was able to compare this field against the other Beacon User and it did not match the provided input data.  &#x60;no_data&#x60; indicates that Plaid was unable to compare this field against the original Beacon User because the field was not present in one of the Beacon Users. */
