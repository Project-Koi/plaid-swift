/** The network or rails used for the transfer. Defaults to &#x60;same-day-ach&#x60;.  For transfers submitted as &#x60;ach&#x60;, the next-day cutoff is 5:30 PM Eastern Time.  For transfers submitted as &#x60;same-day-ach&#x60;, the same-day cutoff is 3:30 PM Eastern Time. If the transfer is submitted after this cutoff but before the next-day cutoff, it will be sent over next-day rails and will not incur same-day charges; this will apply to both legs of the transfer if applicable. */
