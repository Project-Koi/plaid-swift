/** Field describing the overall user interaction signals of a behavior risk check. This value represents how familiar the user is with the personal data they provide, based on a number of signals that are collected during their session.  &#x60;genuine&#x60; indicates the user has high familiarity with the data they are providing, and that fraud is unlikely.  &#x60;neutral&#x60; indicates some signals are present in between &#x60;risky&#x60; and &#x60;genuine&#x60;, but there are not enough clear signals to determine an outcome.  &#x60;risky&#x60; indicates the user has low familiarity with the data they are providing, and that fraud is likely.  &#x60;no_data&#x60; indicates there is not sufficient information to give an accurate signal. */
