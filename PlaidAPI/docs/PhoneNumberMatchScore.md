## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**score** | **Int** | Match score for normalized phone number. 100 is a perfect match, 99-70 is a partial match (matching the same phone number with extension against one without extension, etc.), anything below 70 is considered a mismatch. Typically, the match threshold should be set to a score of 70 or higher. If the phone number is missing from either the API or financial institution, this is null. | [optional]
